# Switch-On-Off-Dell-XPS-Touchpad
## For Dell XPS 13 Older versions

If you have Dell XPS (Older versions like L322,L321,L322x,etc), you may notice that there is no function key to Disable/Enable Touchpad and it's terrible.
If you turn the touchpad off, you may find that it's so difficult to enable the touchpad again or even you need a mouse to do this.
This Program ease your tasks and it makes hotkey for your Touchpad and you can Enable/Disable your touchpad without any difficulties.
